# SystemJS CJS Extra

This package adds the ability to load CJS code in the browser via SystemJS.

This is mostly useful if you want to migrate from SystemJS 0.2x.x to 6.x.x and you do not have control over the built modules that are imported in a project at runtime by SystemJS.

## Installation

`npm install systemjs-cjs-extra`

`import systemjs-cjs-extra`
